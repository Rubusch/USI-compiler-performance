Flexible Statistic Computer

Using a separate ClassLoader just for loading that plug-in. This requires a bit
more work (new URLClassLoader(…), …), but allows plug-ins to sit at any location
(even somewhere on the Internet, or at a place that was not yet known when the
application was started), it allows unloading and reloading, and it even allows
multiple versions of a class with the exact same fully-qualified name to coexist
(if they are defined by different ClassLoader objects).

Run the code as follows:

iDEBIAN<18:54:32>::user("/opt/git_java_performance/A10__FlexibleStatisticsComputer-LotharRubusch/");
$ java -cp bin ch.unisi.inf.sp.statistic.FlexibleStatisticComputer sample.txt Min
3.0
iDEBIAN<18:54:36>::user("/opt/git_java_performance/A10__FlexibleStatisticsComputer-LotharRubusch/");
$ java -cp bin ch.unisi.inf.sp.statistic.FlexibleStatisticComputer sample.txt Max
55.0
