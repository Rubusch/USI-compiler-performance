SimpleStatisticComputer

Using Class.forName(). This requires the least amount of work from you as a
developer, but requires the plug-in classes to be in the same class path as the
application class, and prevents the plug-in from ever being unloaded resp.
reloaded (assume you edit and recompile the plug-in while the application is
running, there is no way for the application to pick up the new version of the
plug-in).

Run the code as follows:
iDEBIAN<18:25:19>::user("/opt/git_java_performance/A10__SimpleStatisticComputer-LotharRubusch/");
$ java -cp bin ch.unisi.inf.sp.statistic.SimpleStatisticComputer sample.txt Min
3.0
iDEBIAN<18:28:56>::user("/opt/git_java_performance/A10__SimpleStatisticComputer-LotharRubusch/");
$ java -cp bin ch.unisi.inf.sp.statistic.SimpleStatisticComputer sample.txt Max
55.0
